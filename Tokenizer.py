# Lexical analysis is the process of breaking the input string into tokens.
# It's the part of the interpreter that turns the input of characters into a stream of tokens.
# Other terms for LA: Lexer, scanner, tokenizer.


# read the input of characters.

# convert it into a stream of tokens.

# return the tokens to feed the parser :)
